We are getting tired of BlueHost SMTP server and wanna get rid of it.
So we made a Yii Framework extension as mail forwarder.

This extension should be treat/used like a normal PHPMailer extension of Yii Framework but to forward the mail request outside of BlueHost (or whatever hosting server you want to get rid of) to the real SMTP server.
If you like to get rid of your hosting provider, make sure your provider should allows your Yii app to make HTTP request.


Dependency

* PHPMailer for Forwarder


Yii config main.php exapmle:

`
	'components'=>array(
		'Smtpmail'=>array(
			'class'=>'application.extensions.mailer.mailer',
			'URL'=>'http://name.or.ip.to.your.forwarder.server/path/to/forwarder/forwarder.php',
			'System'=>'<The subject prefix made by forwarder>',
		),
	)
`

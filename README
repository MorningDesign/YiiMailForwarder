We are getting tired of BlueHost SMTP server and wanna get rid of it.
So we made this mail forwarder Yii Framework extension.


This extension should be treat/used like a normal PHPMailer extension of Yii Framework but to forward the mail request outside of BlueHost (or whatever hosting server you want to get rid of) to the real SMTP server.
Without changing the project's existing sending email code, just replace this PHPMailer extension with this mail forwarder extension.


If you like to get rid of your hosting provider, make sure your provider should allows your Yii app to make HTTP request.

Requirements for forwarder
=========================
* A server that could make SMTP requests and run PHP code

Dependency
=========================
* PHPMailer for Forwarder


Yii config main.php exapmle:

`
	'components'=>array(
		'Smtpmail'=>array(
			'class'=>'application.extensions.mailer.mailer',
			'URL'=>'http://name.or.ip.to.your.forwarder.server/path/to/forwarder/forwarder.php',
			'System'=>'<The subject prefix made by forwarder>',
		),
	)
`
